Docker

1. Docker is a development platform and a virtualization technology that makes it easy for us to develop and deploy apps inside neatly packaged virtual containerized environments.

2. There are two parts to Docker: the Docker image and the Docker container.

3. The Docker image is the file used to execute code in a Docker container.

4. A Docker container is the virtualized runtime environment.

5. You can think of a container as a whole other computer running on your computer, or a virtual computer.

6. You can think of the image as the hard drive for that virtual computer.

7. This means that your software will run the same, no matter where they are or what machine theyâ€™re running on.

8. A docker containerâ€Šcreates a little minicomputer that ensures the environment and settings are the same everywhere.

9. Why Docker is cool

- A Docker image can be used on any computer without any issues. Your software runs on a standard system inside the virtual computer of a Docker container. When it runs on your computer, your teammate's computer, or on Heroku, it will run in identical copies of that virtual computer. There will be no surprises.

- Usually, each Docker container will contain one specific thing. One Django app. One database. One Web server. Each container has its own operating system (a version of Linux), its own virtual CPU, and its own computer memory. It really is like a minicomputer running on your computer.

- These containers make it easy to add, remove, start, and stop lots of different pieces of your application without having to install things on your own computer.

- Finally, these containers, these little minicomputers, can be hooked up so they can talk to each other over their own virtual computer network, like their own WiFi.

10. Why this is important

- In most cases, at any large company, this is how software is now made. You build little applications using Python (or whatever language). Then, you put them into a Docker container. They talk to other applications in other Docker containers. Everything together makes a big application. This is how Netflix is built. This is how Amazon is built. This is how Facebook is built. This is how TV Guide is built.

- We're still building Django applications. We're still using Python. We're just going to start running them inside a virtual computer instead of on our normal computer.

- Learning these skills now allows you to practice them over the rest of the course. This will put you in a great position to understand how to work with "The Cloud", whichever cloud you use.

- All of this makes you a much more attractive candidate in the hiring process. ðŸ˜‰

11. Best to do

The best thing to do is to actually try it out!

Just remember:

Each Docker image is like a hard drive
Each Docker container is like a little running computer

12. Docker has an amazing new built-in tutorial. When going through the tutorial, you don't need to remember everything. Unless you write Docker configuration files every day (most people don't), then you'll invariably forget how to do it. You'll end up back at the Docker documentation, just like the instructors in this course. If we need to write Docker configuration, we go to https://docs.docker.com/  .

13. What's important is that you work through the commands and get a feeling for how to use images, containers, Docker configuration files, binding ports, using Docker volumes, and binding file system mounts. Notice we wrote "feeling." Again, this is not something you have to become completely proficient in.
