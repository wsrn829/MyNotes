CI/CD

1. CI/CD stands for continuous integration/continuous deployment. It is a set of practices and tools that enable you to automate the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors, testing the changes, and delivering the changes to a staging or production environment.

2. Continuous integration is how your branch gets merged into main.

3. Continuous deployment is how main is built (compiled, etc.) then sent to and started on a remote server.

4. The goal of CI/CD is to automate the process of getting your code from your local machine to a remote server.

5. This is important because it allows you to deploy your app early and often, which is important for catching and fixing problems before they become bigger problems.

6. The CI/CD pipeline is the process of getting your code from your local machine to a remote server.

7. The pipeline is made up of a series of steps, each of which is a separate process.

8. The pipeline is usually triggered by a push to a specific branch, such as main.

9. The pipeline is usually defined in a file called .gitlab-ci.yml.

10. The pipeline is usually run by a service such as GitLab CI/CD.

11. The pipeline usually consists of the following steps:

    a. Build: This is where your code is compiled, etc.

    b. Test: This is where your code is tested.

    c. Deploy: This is where your code is deployed to a remote server.

12. When to deploy

    - We want you to deploy early and often, as is recommended for any tech company, so that you can catch and fix any problems before they become bigger problems.

    - Once your app is in a deployable condition, and this doesn't mean complete but rather that your full pipeline is connected from frontend to backend to database, then you can start this step.

    - Do not wait until the last minute to deploy.
